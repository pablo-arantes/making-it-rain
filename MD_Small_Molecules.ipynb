        "Initially, we are going to perform the geometry optimization of the molecule using TorchANI, a PyTorch-based program for training/inference of ANI (ANAKIN-ME) deep learning models to obtain potential energy surfaces and other physical properties of molecular systems. After that, we will use general AMBER force field (GAFF - http://ambermd.org/antechamber/gaff.html) to generate the topology. GAFF is compatible with the AMBER force field and it has parameters for almost all the organic molecules made of C, N, O, H, S, P, F, Cl, Br and I. As a complete force field, GAFF is suitable for study of a great number of molecules in an automatic fashion. We will use LEaP program (https://ambermd.org/tutorials/pengfei/index.php) to build our simulation box. The LEaP program is a portal between many chemical structure file types (.pdb and .mol2, primarily), and the Amber model parameter file types such as .lib, .prepi, parm.dat, and .frcmod. Each of the parameter files contains pieces of information needed for constructing a simulation, whether for energy minimization or molecular dynamics. LEaP functions within a larger workflow described in Section 1.1 of the [Amber Manual](https://ambermd.org/doc12/Amber20.pdf).\n",

The ANI-1 model was developed by random sampling conformational space of 57k organic molecules with up to eight heavy atoms, C, N, and O, plus H atoms to have proper chemistry, then running DFT calculations to obtain potential energies for training. ANI-1x was trained to a data set of molecular conformations sampled through an active learning scheme. Active learning is where the model itself is iteratively used to decide what new data should be included in the next iteration. ANI-1ccx was trained to the ANI-1x data set, then retrained to a 10% smaller data set of accurate coupled cluster calculations, resulting in a potential that outperformed DFT in test cases. ANI-2x was trained by adding many millions of data points to the ANI-1x data set, at the same level of theory, but including elements S, F, and Cl. We included the **ANI-1x**, **ANI-1ccx**, and **ANI-2x** models in our notebook.\n",
